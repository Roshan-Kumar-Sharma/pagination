# complex-pagination

A more sophisticated example of pagination. You will see more functionality like shifting of page number in buttons, highlighting the current page button etc.

## pagination means to limit the number of data shown on a page.

I have used only js and fetch API to create this project. [JSON placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) This is the link which I have used for data source.

More branches will be created to demonstrate how we can implement pagination using database(using mongoDB).

I hope you will learn somthing new from this.
