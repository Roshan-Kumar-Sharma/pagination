# pagination

A simple project to demonstrate how we can implement pagination in our project.

## Branches

complex-pagination

## pagination means to limit the number of data shown on a page.

I have used only js and fetch API to create this project. [Github USERS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/googleapis#google-apis) This is the link which I have used for data source.

More branches will be created to demonstrate how we can implement pagination using database(using mongoDB).

I hope you will learn somthing new from this.
